# Understanding the Status and Strategies of the Code Signing Abuse Ecosystem
Artifact for *Understanding the Status and Strategies of the Code Signing Abuse Ecosystem*

The artifact contains a CSV table and a ZIP folder of certificate files. The CSV file mainly records metadata of abusive certificates—such as hash, serial number, subject, issuer, validity period, and abuse category—and provides the VirusTotal report of one representative software sample signed by each certificate. The ZIP folder contains the original .cer files of all abused certificates listed in the CSV. Each file is named after its MD5 value, and the total number of certificates (2,072) is consistent with the description in Section IV.C of the paper.
